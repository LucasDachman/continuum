[Continuum](lucasdachman.github.io/continuum) is a multiplayer music web app that can be used for idea generation or pure entertainment. The app provides a minimal virtual workspace for up to three artists to collaboratively write and perform electronic music. All changes to the interface and sound engine are synched between all participants. The app features a 16 step sequencer and three expressive instruments whose sounds can be modulated by dials on the interface. Each player is delegated an instrument—they can only edit the instrument’s dedicated notes and modulation parameters. After one minute, instruments are automatically swapped. The total number of notes in the workspace is limited to avoid crowding and encourage minimalism. Continuum is an infinite music experience. There is no concept of a finite session and so new players will pick up where others left off. Visit Continuum at [lucasdachman.github.io/continuum](lucasdachman.github.io/continuum)
